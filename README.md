### What I learned

What I learned from creating the project Stats preview card component is how to use BEM method for naming convention in HTML and CSS. This method is new to me so I still try to experiment how to use it and make it more understanding to read the syntax, but it's worth it to try something new üòÅ.

I want to continue this project to collaborate with my other projects in the future.
